/// Provides an interface for Virtual File System (VFS) operations.
/// 
/// This module defines traits for filesystem-level and node-level operations,
/// enabling the implementation of various filesystems and their integration
/// into the VFS layer. The `VfsOps` trait represents operations on the
/// filesystem as a whole, while the `VfsNodeOps` trait represents operations
/// on individual files or directories.
